            <br />
            - 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
            <br />
            - 3/4 cup granulated sugar
            <br />
            - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
            <br />
            - 1/2 tsp ground ginger
            <br />
            - 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
            <br />
            - 1/4 tsp salt
            <br />
            - 2 large eggs
            <br />
            - 1 cup evaporated milk
            <br />
            - 1 cup mini marshmallows
            <br />
            Instructions:
            1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
            <br />
            2. Place the pie crust in a 9-inch pie dish and crimp the edges as desired.
            <br />
            3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Mix until well combined.
            <br />
            4. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated.
            <br />
            5. Gradually stir in the evaporated milk until the mixture is smooth.
            <br />
            6. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared pie crust.
            <br />
            7. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
            <br />
            8. After 15 minutes, remove the pie from the oven and carefully sprinkle the mini marshmallows over the top.
            <br />
            9. Return the pie to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the marshmallows are golden brown and the filling is set.
            <br />
            10. Once done, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool completely before serving.

            Enjoy your delicious Pumpkin Marshmallow Pie!
